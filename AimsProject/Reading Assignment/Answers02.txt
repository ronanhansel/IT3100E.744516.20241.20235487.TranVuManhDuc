 
Question: 
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this? 
 Answer:
-	No, It doesn’t. Because two constructs have same construct’s name and same type of  parameter String, so It can’t distinguish two ones.
